# Ledger (v1 scaffold)

Ledger is a human-in-the-loop AI Ops panel for turning repo evidence into approved social posts, without losing human authorship. It is intentionally read-only against source repos, and it never posts without explicit approval records. This repo ships a minimal scaffold that keeps boundaries clear while the workflow matures.

Start here:
- `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` (single source of truth)
- `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (local setup, scripts, DB/migrations)
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (Railway)

Docs map:
- `docs/SYSTEM_PUBLIC.md`
- `docs/SYSTEM_ADMIN.md`
- `docs/SYSTEM_OPS.md`
- `docs/PAGESPEED_TRADEOFFS.md`
- `docs/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_SUMMARY.md`
